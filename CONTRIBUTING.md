# Contributing to RideLink

Thank you for your interest in contributing to RideLink! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ridelink-launcher.git
   cd ridelink-launcher
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your Google Maps API key
5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep components small and focused

### File Organization

- Place reusable components in `/components`
- Use the `/hooks` directory for custom hooks
- Keep contexts in `/contexts`
- Follow the existing folder structure

### Testing

- Test your changes on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web)
- Ensure the app works without a Google Maps API key (graceful degradation)
- Test with different languages (English, Portuguese, Spanish)
- Verify location services work properly

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add support for new ride app
fix: resolve location permission issue on Android
docs: update API setup instructions
